This is part of a semester-long project for the spring of 2021, and it is a requirements-based project where I partner with a sponsor company. With this company, we go through all the different
fundamental requirements activities. For this part, I built a prototype as a way to validate my requirements. I build this simple prototype as a potential idea of what the system
could look like given the requirements created up to this point. I then presented this to 3 different stakeholders to gain feedback and add to or adjust my requirements.

The project has just finished it's third sprint in December of 2020, and I am much more proficient in Object Oriented Programming. I enjoyed the project because it was a project that allowed freedom throughout the implementation process. Which allowed me to refine my critical thinking skills, and work on good programming habits.
